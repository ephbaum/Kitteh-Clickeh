# Kitteh-Clickeh

A version of the Cat Clicker project from [Udacity](https://udacity.com) course [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989)



### Project Requirements for Cat Clicker (v1)

#### Visuals

- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
Interaction

- The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked.

## TODO
Add more details, maybe.
